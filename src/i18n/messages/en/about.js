  bio: `I'm a Software Engineer focused on building a better web using JavaScript.
    Landing a career in tech changed my life, and for that reason, I like to participate in
    software development education initiatives so that many more lives can change.<br />
    These initiatives have allowed me to have the honor of being recognized as a 
    <b>GitHub Campus Expert</b>, <b>Google Developer Expert</b> and <b>Women Techmakers Ambassador</b>.<br />
    I currently work at Uber in Amsterdam<br/>
    Besides software development, in my free time I like to crochet, take care of my plants and play with my dog.`
